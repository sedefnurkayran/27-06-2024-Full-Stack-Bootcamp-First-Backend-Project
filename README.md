ASP.NET Core, a framework for developing web applications and services, is a redesigned version of ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API, combining them into a single programming model.

The main features of ASP.NET Core are as follows:

Open source and free.

While ASP.NET can develop Windows-based web applications, ASP.NET Core is compatible with all platforms such as Windows, macOS and Linux, thus providing cross-platform support.

ASP.NET Core offers modular components through NuGet packages. Developers can make applications lightweight and optimized by adding only the components they need to the project file. For example, the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package provides MVC support. This enables the development of lighter and more performant applications.

Scalability is one of the strengths of ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core's modular, lightweight and high-performance structure, horizontal and vertical scalability solutions, and support for microservices and serverless architectures ensure that applications can meet increasing workloads and user demands. This is a critical feature for modern cloud-based applications
